GPSoverCAN
==========

Arduino code for using a Venus GPS module &amp; an Arduino to transmit over CAN

NOTE: We're not sure if this works. Our CAN shield is making some funny outputs (oscilliscope waveform doesn't look like CAN is supposed to). We think the chip on the shield is busted. Will update.
