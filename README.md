GPSoverCAN
==========

Arduino code for using a Venus GPS module & an Arduino to transmit over CAN
The current working code is in the top level gpsinterface. GPS has test code, and CAN_BUS_Shield-master is Seeed Studio's CAN bus code.

NOTE: We're not sure if this actually works. Our CAN shield is making some funny outputs (see the jpegs in the repository). We think the chip on the shield is broken, but we can't tell until we get another device that can take CAN inputs.
